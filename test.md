# DiagramApp Frontend

This is the frontend part of DiagramApp, a collaborative, real-time diagramming web application.

## Installation

To install and run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```

   This will start the frontend server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

To run the tests for the frontend, use the following command:

```bash

```

This will run all the tests and display the results in the console.

## Usage
