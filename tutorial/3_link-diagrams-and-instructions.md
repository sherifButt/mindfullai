# 3. Link diagrams and instructions

In a typical full-stack application where you have a frontend, backend, and a database, you would have to handle user interactions, process them in the backend and persist data in your database. In the context of using React Flow to define a sequence of operations that will be executed in the backend, you can create entities for diagrams and instructions.

Let's break it down:

1. **Diagrams**: These would be the actual representation of your flow chart that you create on the frontend using React Flow. Each diagram is stored as a JSON object, which represents the state of the diagram. Each node in the diagram can have an associated instruction, which can be denoted by a unique identifier.

   This is an example of what a Diagram table might look like:
process-the-diagram
    ```
    Diagram Table
    ----------------
    ID | Name   | Diagram_JSON
    1  | 'Flow1'| {"nodes":[{"id":"node1","type":"start","data":{"label":"Start","instruction_id": 1}}, {"id":"node2","type":"end","data":{"label":"End","instruction_id": 2}}]}
    ```

    This is a mermaid sequence diagram for saving a diagram:

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant U as User
        participant F as Frontend
        participant B as Backend
        participant D as Database
        U->>F: Create Diagram
        F->>B: Send Diagram Data
        B->>D: Save Diagram in Database
        D->>B: Confirm Diagram Save
        B->>F: Send Diagram Save Confirmation
        F->>U: Show Diagram Save Confirmation
    ```

2. **Instructions**: These are the actions that each node in the flow chart would represent. Each instruction can have a unique identifier which can be used to link it to a node in a diagram.

    This is an example of what an Instruction table might look like:

    ```
    Instruction Table
    -----------------
    ID | InstructionType | Params
    1  | 'start'         | {}
    2  | 'end'           | {}
    ```

    This is a mermaid sequence diagram for saving an instruction:

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant U as User
        participant F as Frontend
        participant B as Backend
        participant D as Database
        U->>F: Create Instruction
        F->>B: Send Instruction Data
        B->>D: Save Instruction in Database
        D->>B: Confirm Instruction Save
        B->>F: Send Instruction Save Confirmation
        F->>U: Show Instruction Save Confirmation
    ```

3. **Linking Diagrams and Instructions**: Each node in your Diagram can be associated with an instruction in the Instructions table. This can be done by storing the instruction ID as part of the node's data in the Diagram JSON. When you want to execute the logic defined by the Diagram, you can parse the Diagram JSON, extract the instruction IDs, fetch the corresponding Instructions from the Instruction table, and execute them in the order defined by the Diagram. 

   This is a mermaid sequence diagram for linking diagram nodes with instructions and executing them:

   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant U as User
       participant F as Frontend
       participant B as Backend
       participant D as Database
       participant S as Server-side Logic
       U->>F: Request to Execute Diagram
       F->>B: Send Request with Diagram ID
       B->>D: Fetch Diagram and Instructions
       B->>S: Execute Instructions in Diagram Order
       S->>B: Return Execution Results
       B->>F: Send Execution Results


       F->>U: Show Execution Results
   ```

    In this sequence, when a user requests to execute a diagram, the frontend sends the request to the backend with the diagram ID. The backend fetches the diagram and its linked instructions from the database. The backend then executes the instructions in the order specified in the diagram and returns the results back to the frontend for the user to view.
